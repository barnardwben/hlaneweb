Personal realtor website built for a Twin Cities Realtor. This site
            includes implementation of the latest React.js with Hooks included.
            I also used d3.js for the data visualization of a mortgage
            calculator I built. Site is fully responsive for all devices, and
            rated high in lighthouse's SEO and Accessibility scale.
